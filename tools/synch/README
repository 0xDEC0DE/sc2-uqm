Ur-Quan Masters Voice-over synchronization tool

To Build:
	The code can be compiled with the provided Makefile, Windows
	users can build it by installing Cygwin or MinGW and using
	the build tools provided. (or by rolling their own Visual Studio
	project file, if they have MSVC++, which I don't)

	You'll need fltk (1.1.x), oggvorbis, and SDL development libraries 
	installed.

To Use:
	Place the executable in the UQM content directory and run it.
	Select the files you want to play, and hit start.
	Hitting 'n' is the same as 'Next Screen', and 'p' will pause/unpause.

	Hitting 'space' or 'enter' may have adverse effects, so don't  ;)

	The program will write out intermediate files into
	content/timestamp/[race]

	Once finished, use the merge_ts_files.pl script (requires
	Perl) to convert the intermediate files into .ts files that
	the game uses, and submit the new files to the project via
	Bugzilla (http://uqm.stack.nl/cgi-bin/bugs/index.cgi)
