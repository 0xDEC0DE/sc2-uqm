Ur-Quan Masters Voice-over synchronization tool

For Windows:
	Unpack into any directory.
	From a DOS prompt, execute Synchronizer.exx from within the UQM content
	directory it will write out files into content/timestamp/race
	When you are done, archive them, and send to:
		tcpaiqgvnmbf28f001@sneakemail.com

To use, select the files you want to play, and  hit start.
hitting 'n' is the same as 'Next Screen', and 'p' will pause/unpause.

Hitting 'space' or 'enter' may have adverse effects, so don't

	The code can be compiled with:
		gcc synch.cpp synchronizer.cpp audioSDL.cpp audio.cpp -o synch -DUSE_SDLAUDIO=1 -lfltk -lvorbisfile -lvorbis `sdl-config --cflags --libs`

	You'll need fltk (1.1.x), oggvorbis, and SDL development libraries 
installed.
