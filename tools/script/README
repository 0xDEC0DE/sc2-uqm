Scriptcheck, v0.1

This is a simple Python (v.2 and up) script to look for unusual
properties in the conversation files.  It looks for spaces at the
beginnings and ends of lines where this would suppress "..." creation
(see docs/SCRIPT for more details on this) and compares the
identifiers named in the .txt file with the values of the enums in the
corresponding strings.h files.

Run it from this directory or it won't be able to find the necessary
.txt and .h files.

v0.1, 15 Oct 2002: Initial release (Michael Martin)
