This is a lightly adapted version of the SDL documentation's example
of keyboard access.  It may be used to determine Key Jamming
information.

It will spawn a little window, then give information in the console.
To exit the program, close the little window.

Obvious enhancements to this will be to have the little window *be*
the key jamming interface, and a KEYS.EXE-like real-time status
report.
