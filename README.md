# The Ur-Quan Masters - Extended Edition

Welcome! This project is a modest, unofficial fork/sub-project of
The Ur-Quan Masters, aimed at enhancing the single-player game's
atmosphere, story depth and continutity. No changes were made to
the main plot, but various plot elements have been added to make
the game world seem that much more "full", and gameplay more
satisfying. If you've played the game before, this means that it's
the same game, just with more side-plots and whatnot to find/explore.
If you've never played the game before, this version is every bit
as feature-complete as the "official release", but with some extra
features.

## Key Differences

### No voices included

They ruin EVERYTHING, even to the point of obscuring some plot
points, and making it harder for new players to win the game.

If you still want voices, you can install them, but seriously.
Don't.

### More stuff

The characters in-game mention various places and things that are,
in this version, also scattered around the galaxy for the player
to find and explore.

### Minor Bugfixes and Enhancements

Some bugs in the game haven't been fixed in the "official" release
yet. None of them are crash bugs or show-stoppers, but usually mild
annoyances or inconsistencies that this version aims to see
annigilated... I mean annihigated.. damn!

See the commit history for a full list of changes.
