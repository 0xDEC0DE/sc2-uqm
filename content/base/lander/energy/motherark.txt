#(MOTHER_ARK 1)
     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

WE HAVE UNCOVERED WHAT LITTLE IS LEFT OF THE MMRNMHRM MOTHER-ARK.  WE CAN FIND NO OTHER EVIDENCE THAT THE MMRNMHRM WERE EVER HERE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS MOON USED TO BE THEIR HOMEWORLD.

WE KNEW THAT THE MMRNMHRM CHOSE TO BE SLAVE-SHIELDED WITH THE CHENJESU AT PROCYON, BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT IN DOING SO, THEY PICKED UP THEIR ENTIRE CIVILIZATION AND MOVED IT OFF-WORLD.

AT THIS POINT, THE MOTHER-ARK IS JUST SO MUCH ALIEN JUNK.  WE HAVE MADE HOLOS OF EVERYTHING, BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE MUCH USE TO ANYONE BUT THOSE EGGHEAD XENOTECHS BACK AT THE BASE.

        ---- END OF REPORT ----
