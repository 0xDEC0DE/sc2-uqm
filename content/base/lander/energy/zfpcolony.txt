     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

THESE RUINS SEEM TO BE REMNANTS OF COLONY WORLDS FROM A NEARBY CIVILIZATION KNOWN AS THE `ZOQ-FOT-PIK'.  THEY HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DESTROYED.

THE COLONIES APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THEIR HOMEWORLD UP UNTIL THE POINT OF THEIR DESTRUCTION, WHICH THEIR RECORDS SHOW WAS THE RESULT OF AN UNPROVOKED ORBITAL ATTACK FROM AN UNKNOWN RACE.

THERE ARE NO SURVIVORS.

        ---- END OF REPORT ----
