Before doing any non-trivial, please discuss it first in the IRC channel
(channel #sc2 at irc.freenode.net), or the mailing list
(sc2-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). Be sure to be in agreement with the
people actually working on the project; it would be a shame if you put a lot
of effort into something, and then having to find out it won't be accepted
into the cvs tree. Note that v1.0 will pretty much be a straight port,
with no gameplay-altering features added.

All known bugs and missing features are now listed in our bugzilla database.
It can be found at http://uqm.stack.nl/cgi-bin/bugs/index.cgi


Questions:
- Is there some way to automatically do CRLF translations on commits,
  with the -t and -f options in cvswrapper disabled by sourceforge?
- w_memlib used (now commented out) MS Windows functions to show messages
  when memory couldn't be allocated. If we want to have those return, some
  work will have to be done. If not, there's some dead code to remove.
- If we want, we could allocate a block of reserve memory at the start,
  which we can free when no more memory is available, to allow an emergency
  save.
- How about an ISO image for a self-contained linux CD which boots into SC2?
