#(WE_ARE0)	ZOQFO000.wav
Attention starship!
We are the Zoq-Fot-Pik.
#(WE_ARE1)	ZOQFO001.wav
Make no hostile actions!
#(WE_ARE2)	ZOQFO002.wav
We come in peace, and with good will.
#(WE_ARE3)	ZOQFO003.wav
But if you make one false move, you're vapor!
#(WE_ARE4)	ZOQFO004.wav
Don't worry, my companion is just a bit nervous
#(WE_ARE5)	ZOQFO005.wav
No, I'm not!
#(WE_ARE6)	ZOQFO006.wav
and argumentative.
#(WE_ARE7)	ZOQFO007.wav
No, I'm not.

#(SCOUT_HELLO0)	ZOQFO008.wav
We are a scout vessel
dispatched from our homeworld.
#(SCOUT_HELLO1)	ZOQFO009.wav
We have travelled far
through hostile, uncharted space
to find you.
We hail from the green dwarf star at coordinates
ziggerfau-gerrrnuf, Ah-ah, Pahoy-hoy.
#(SCOUT_HELLO2)	ZOQFO010.wav
No, you idiot, in their coordinate system!
#(SCOUT_HELLO3)	ZOQFO011.wav
Oh!
Er
Coordinates 400.0 : 543.7.

#(INIT_HOME_HELLO0)	ZOQFO012.wav
You have arrived at our homeworld.
#(INIT_HOME_HELLO1)	ZOQFO013.wav
And we've got a billion ships here!
#(INIT_HOME_HELLO2)	ZOQFO014.wav
We are fortunate that you have found us in our time of need.
#(INIT_HOME_HELLO3)	ZOQFO015.wav
So don't even think of trying to attack us!


#(which_fot)
Which one of you creatures is the Fot?

#(HE_IS0)	ZOQFO016.wav
He is.
#(HE_IS1)	ZOQFO017.wav
No, she is!
#(HE_IS2)	ZOQFO018.wav
No, I'm not!
#(HE_IS3)	ZOQFO019.wav
Yes, you are.
#(HE_IS4)	ZOQFO020.wav
Cripes! We've been through this a million times!
#(HE_IS5)	ZOQFO021.wav
That doesn't change anything. You're the Fot!
#(HE_IS6)	ZOQFO022.wav
Faugh!
Well, Captain, as you can see, this is a point of some contention.
#(HE_IS7)	ZOQFO023.wav
Fot!

#(we_are_vindicator0)
We are 
#(we_are_vindicator1)
 flagship 
#(we_are_vindicator2)
 from Earth.  What are your intentions?

#(WE_GLAD0)	ZOQFO024.wav
Hurrah!
Then we've finally found our saviors!
#(WE_GLAD1)	ZOQFO025.wav
Maybe.
#(WE_GLAD2)	ZOQFO026.wav
At last, our search is over!
It is just as the great Crystal ones promised!
#(WE_GLAD3)	ZOQFO027.wav
They look sneaky.
I think they're lying.
#(WE_GLAD4)	ZOQFO028.wav
Quiet, fool!
Can't you see our nightmare is over!?
This ship is from the Great Crystal One's fabled Alliance
the Alliance of Free Stars!
#(WE_GLAD5)	ZOQFO029.wav
Maybe.

#(quiet_toadies)
SILENCE BLATHERING TOADIES! We are your new masters.

#(TOLD_YOU0)	ZOQFO030.wav
We are disappointed.
#(TOLD_YOU1)	ZOQFO031.wav
See! I TOLD you!
#(TOLD_YOU2)	ZOQFO032.wav
We had hoped that our species could be friends.
#(TOLD_YOU3)	ZOQFO033.wav
Never in a million years! Just look at their beady eyes!
#(TOLD_YOU4)	ZOQFO034.wav
But in the spirit of understanding...
#(TOLD_YOU5)	ZOQFO035.wav
Oh, no! You're not even considering...
#(TOLD_YOU6)	ZOQFO036.wav
...We will forgive you this transgression.
#(TOLD_YOU7)	ZOQFO037.wav
Sheesh! What a pushover you are!

#(your_race)
Before we go on, can you tell us more about your species?

#(YEARS_AGO0)	ZOQFO038.wav
In our ancient past, four species evolved intelligence on our homeworld.
#(YEARS_AGO1)	ZOQFO039.wav	
Simultaneously.
#(YEARS_AGO2)	ZOQFO040.wav
They were the Zoq
#(YEARS_AGO3)	ZOQFO041.wav
the Fot
#(YEARS_AGO4)	ZOQFO042.wav
the Pik
#(YEARS_AGO5)	ZOQFO043.wav
and the Zebranky.
#(YEARS_AGO6)	ZOQFO044.wav
We three, the Zoq, Fot, and Pik evolved in such a way
as to acquire sustenance from many sources
#(YEARS_AGO7)	ZOQFO045.wav
from airborne zooplankton
#(YEARS_AGO8)	ZOQFO046.wav
from solar and ambient energies
#(YEARS_AGO9)	ZOQFO047.wav
and from rocky fungal clingers.
#(YEARS_AGO10)	ZOQFO048.wav
Our favorite!
#(YEARS_AGO11)	ZOQFO049.wav
The Zebranky also consumed a variety of foods
namely: the Zoq
the Fot
and the Pik.
#(YEARS_AGO12)	ZOQFO050.wav
To survive the predations of the Zebranky
we banded together
annihilated the Zebranky
#(YEARS_AGO13)	ZOQFO051.wav
and formed the cooperative union you now encounter.

#(where_from)
What do you seek from us?

#(TRAVELED_FAR0)	ZOQFO052.wav
We are a relatively peaceful group of species.
#(TRAVELED_FAR1)	ZOQFO053.wav
Unless we're angry.
#(TRAVELED_FAR2)	ZOQFO054.wav
So we find ourselves in need of help.
#(TRAVELED_FAR3)	ZOQFO055.wav
We only need a LITTLE!
#(TRAVELED_FAR4)	ZOQFO056.wav
Because of our desperate situation.
#(TRAVELED_FAR5)	ZOQFO057.wav
`Desperate' is too strong a word.
I think `troublesome' is more like it.


#(what_emergency)
What `nightmare' are you talking about? What's the matter?


#(UNDER_ATTACK0)	ZOQFO058.wav
Our planets are under attack from an invading horde!
#(UNDER_ATTACK1)	ZOQFO059.wav
We do not know who they are, or why they are here.
#(UNDER_ATTACK2)	ZOQFO060.wav
We are being blown to bits.
#(UNDER_ATTACK3)	ZOQFO061.wav
Fleets of alien ships appear out of nowhere\n
then unleash terrible destructive energies.
#(UNDER_ATTACK4)	ZOQFO062.wav
Fortunately
#(UNDER_ATTACK5)	ZOQFO063.wav
they release these energies on each other.
#(UNDER_ATTACK6)	ZOQFO064.wav
Unfortunately
#(UNDER_ATTACK7)	ZOQFO065.wav
they favor combat near strong gravity wells.
Their stray shots regularly strike the surface of our planets\n
often with tragic results.
#(UNDER_ATTACK8)	ZOQFO066.wav
Fortunately
#(UNDER_ATTACK9)	ZOQFO067.wav
they have never found our homeworld, only our colony planets.
#(UNDER_ATTACK10)	ZOQFO068.wav
Unfortunately
#(UNDER_ATTACK11)	ZOQFO069.wav
all of our colonies have perished as a consequence.

#(tough_luck)
Hey, space is a tough place where wimps eat flaming plasma death.

#(NOT_HELPFUL0)	ZOQFO070.wav
Oh, dear.
#(NOT_HELPFUL1)	ZOQFO071.wav
I told you he looked like a creep!
#(NOT_HELPFUL2)	ZOQFO072.wav
No! We must try to understand.
His ways are not like our own.
#(NOT_HELPFUL3)	ZOQFO073.wav
You mean his WHOLE SPECIES are jerks?
#(NOT_HELPFUL4)	ZOQFO074.wav
Let us give him one more chance.
#(NOT_HELPFUL5)	ZOQFO075.wav
Just look at him. He's a killer, I tell you.

#(what_look_like)
Who is attacking you? What do they look like?

#(LOOK_LIKE0)	ZOQFO076.wav
Some of the vessels are huge, green battleships
which launch wave after wave of small fighters.
#(LOOK_LIKE1)	ZOQFO077.wav
The other ships are black as space
and their hulls are carved with strange alien writing.
#(LOOK_LIKE2)	ZOQFO078.wav
In combat the two ships seem evenly matched.
#(LOOK_LIKE3)	ZOQFO079.wav
One fires blasts of fusion energy
while the other launches spinning projectiles.


#(valuable_info)
You have given us valuable information. Goodbye.

#(GOODBYE0)	ZOQFO080.wav
If you must go now, we understand.
#(GOODBYE1)	ZOQFO081.wav
That's it?! You're leaving?!!
#(GOODBYE2)	ZOQFO082.wav
We hope that on your next visit
we can establish a mutual assistance pact.
#(GOODBYE3)	ZOQFO083.wav
I can't believe that he's just leaving us here!
...what a jerk.

#(all_very_interesting)
Yes, yes, that's all very interesting, but now we are going to attack you!

#(SEE_TOLD_YOU0)	ZOQFO084.wav
What?
#(SEE_TOLD_YOU1)	ZOQFO085.wav
See! I told you.!...
...but would you listen... NO!
#(SEE_TOLD_YOU2)	ZOQFO086.wav
I don't understand!
#(SEE_TOLD_YOU3)	ZOQFO087.wav
So what does all your nicey-nice to the alien get us?
Nothing! That's what!
You should have done what I said
and told him we were the Precursors.


#(how_can_i_help)
We want to help. What can we do?

#(ALLY_WITH_US0)	ZOQFO088.wav
We would like to establish
a formal mutual-assistance pact
with your species.
#(ALLY_WITH_US1)	ZOQFO089.wav
One of those `You scratch my vent
I'll scratch your flipper' set-ups.
#(ALLY_WITH_US2)	ZOQFO090.wav
And as a sign of our good faith
we will provide you with skilled Captains
and plans for building our `Stinger' starships.
#(ALLY_WITH_US3)	ZOQFO091.wav
In return, if the bad guys find our homeworld
you'll rush over here and vaporize 'em.
#(ALLY_WITH_US4)	ZOQFO092.wav
That is, essentially, correct.
#(ALLY_WITH_US5)	ZOQFO093.wav
Great deal, eh?
	"You can't afford to pass it up!"
So what do you say?

#(decide_later)
Uh... I need to consult with our, er... our Grand-High Poobah!

#(PLEASE_HURRY0)	ZOQFO094.wav
Please hurry back with word from your Poobah.
Millions of lives are at stake!
#(PLEASE_HURRY1)	ZOQFO095.wav
Not the least of which is mine.

#(EMMISSARIES0)	ZOQFO096.wav
These are the words we have prayed for!
#(EMMISSARIES1)	ZOQFO097.wav
Hey! This trip's not a waste after all!
#(EMMISSARIES2)	ZOQFO098.wav
More than anything, we seek an ally
to help us survive in this hostile universe.
#(EMMISSARIES3)	ZOQFO099.wav
We are having some problems of that general nature.
#(EMMISSARIES4)	ZOQFO100.wav
But we are only emissaries.
You must meet with our leaders.
They are wiser... more powerful beings!
#(EMMISSARIES5)	ZOQFO101.wav
They look just like us, though.
#(EMMISSARIES6)	ZOQFO102.wav
Fly to the star called Alpha Tucanae.
The planet closest to the sun is our home.
#(EMMISSARIES7)	ZOQFO103.wav
And if possible, hurry.


#(sure)
	"You are under attack by the Ur-Quan, our enemy as well. "
Therefore, speaking for all the People of Earth, I accept your offer.

#(WE_ALLY0)	ZOQFO104.wav
How wonderful!
#(WE_ALLY1)	ZOQFO105.wav
Hurray!
#(WE_ALLY2)	ZOQFO106.wav
How marvelous!
#(WE_ALLY3)	ZOQFO107.wav
Yee-ha!
#(WE_ALLY4)	ZOQFO108.wav
Captain, we shall begin fulfilling our commitment at once!
We will begin transporting our officers to your base immediately!
#(WE_ALLY5)	ZOQFO109.wav
Why, heck!
Maybe I'll even make the trip to your planet!
I'd make a good starship captain, Captain!
I'm pretty darn mean in a fight
and there ain't nobody better than me
with a thrusting stinger tongue attack!

#(never)
What? Protect you failures? No way! You're too lame!

#(WE_ENEMIES0)	ZOQFO110.wav
We have revealed ourselves to you.
We have held out our appendages to you in friendship!...
...and you have treated us like dead Zebrankys.
It takes a great deal to anger one of my species, Captain
BUT YOU HAVE JUST SUCCEEDED!
Attention Shipmates! Man the spray gun! Hoist the tongue!
PREPARE FOR BATTLE!
#(WE_ENEMIES1)	ZOQFO111.wav
Yeah.
Let's toast those creeps!


#(HOSTILE_HELLO_10)	ZOQFO112.wav
Coming here was pointless, human.
Our species are at war.
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_11)	ZOQFO113.wav
Right!
Prepare to die, alien scum!

#(HOSTILE_HELLO_20)	ZOQFO114.wav
If you had allied with us, Captain
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_21)	ZOQFO115.wav
Which you didn't!
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_22)	ZOQFO116.wav
We would gladly tell you what we have learned
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_23)	ZOQFO117.wav
Which we won't!
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_24)	ZOQFO118.wav
Regarding the two warring alien factions\n
the Ur-Quan and their siblings, the Kohr-Ah.
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_25)	ZOQFO119.wav
But now you'll NEVER know!
	

#(HOSTILE_HELLO_30)	ZOQFO120.wav
With whatever remaining forces we have
we will do our best to destroy you.
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_31)	ZOQFO121.wav
Yeah! And she means it too!

#(HOSTILE_HELLO_40)	ZOQFO122.wav
Your villainy is beyond possible forgiveness!
We are compelled by our anger to destroy you.
#(HOSTILE_HELLO_41)	ZOQFO123.wav
He's probably just gonna run away again.
The coward!


#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_10)	ZOQFO124.wav
Ah! It is the alien from the Chenjesu's Alliance!
#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_11)	ZOQFO125.wav
Just look at those weapon pods on his ship.
#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_12)	ZOQFO126.wav
We hope that during this visit
we can make clear to your species
the benefits of a mutual-assistance pact.
#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_13)	ZOQFO127.wav
But we're also armed to the teeth
so don't try stealing our atmosphere or anything sneaky like that!


#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_20)	ZOQFO128.wav
Once more, the Alliance starship has returned.
#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_21)	ZOQFO129.wav
Yeah. I bet THIS is the time they try to trick us.
#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_22)	ZOQFO130.wav
Alien Captain, do you bring word from your Leaders?
#(NEUTRAL_HOME_HELLO_23)	ZOQFO131.wav
If he does, I bet it's something like
Submit or be Eaten!


#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_10)	ZOQFO132.wav
Hello friend and ally!
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_11)	ZOQFO133.wav
Got any presents for us?
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_12)	ZOQFO134.wav
We hope your struggle against the Ur-Quan goes well!
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_13)	ZOQFO135.wav
Darn! He never gives us anything.


#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_20)	ZOQFO136.wav
Welcome back to our world.
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_21)	ZOQFO137.wav
Yeah, welcome back to our world!
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_22)	ZOQFO138.wav
I just said that.
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_23)	ZOQFO139.wav
So? It doesn't mean I can't say it too.
Besides, you always get to talk first.
That's not fair!
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_24)	ZOQFO140.wav
Sorry, that's just the way it is.
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_25)	ZOQFO141.wav
Well why?! That doesn't make sense.
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_26)	ZOQFO142.wav
Look, don't ask me.
I think it's something technical.
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_27)	ZOQFO143.wav
Yeah, right. I'm so sure.
What a lame excuse.

#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_30)	ZOQFO144.wav
Greetings Captain.
What can your allies do for you?
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_31)	ZOQFO145.wav
Your favorite allies!

#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_40)	ZOQFO146.wav
Hello human ally.
We are at your service.
#(ALLIED_HOME_HELLO_41)	ZOQFO147.wav
What do you want?

#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE0)	ZOQFO148.wav
Our Savior! Our Savior!
You have rescued us from certain destruction!
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE1)	ZOQFO149.wav
Howee-baby! That was a close one!
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE2)	ZOQFO150.wav
The black ship appeared in orbit several days ago
and began raining down bolts of destructive energy
on the surface of our planet!
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE3)	ZOQFO151.wav
Fortunately
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE4)	ZOQFO152.wav
We were able to focus our planetary shields
to deflect the energy blasts away from our cities.
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE5)	ZOQFO153.wav
Unfortunately
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE6)	ZOQFO154.wav
Large sections of our planet's beautiful wilderness
have been annihilated... entire ecosystems destroyed.
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE7)	ZOQFO155.wav
Oh! That makes me REALLY mad!
I mean, attacking helpless, intelligent, alien species
that's one thing
but toasting our cute little wood Jukes and tree Narfs
that's really low!
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE8)	ZOQFO156.wav
If the black ship had been accompanied by others of its kind
we wouldn't have been able stop the rain of destruction.
They would have killed us all.
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE9)	ZOQFO157.wav
Well in that case, better those Jukes and Narfs than us, right?
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE10)	ZOQFO158.wav
Captain, it is clear that in matters of war
you are more capable than ourselves.
With this in mind, we would like to give you
our four finest starships and crew.
I hope they bring you many victories.
#(THANKS_FOR_RESCUE11)	ZOQFO159.wav
Try not to lose them all right away.
	

#(bye_homeworld)
Bye Zoq. Bye Fot. Bye Pik.

#(GOODBYE_HOME0)
Goodbye Captain.
#(GOODBYE_HOME1)
See ya.

#(whats_up_homeworld)
So, what's happening around here?

#(GENERAL_INFO_10)	ZOQFO160.wav
We had a close call last week.
#(GENERAL_INFO_11)	ZOQFO161.wav
One of those black ships was snooping around the system.
#(GENERAL_INFO_12)	ZOQFO162.wav
But before it got to our world
some of the Green ships warped in
destroyed the black vessel
and then left immediately.
#(GENERAL_INFO_13)	ZOQFO163.wav
We got lucky.


#(GENERAL_INFO_20)	ZOQFO164.wav
It's been pretty quiet, Captain.\n
Nothing new to report.
#(GENERAL_INFO_21)	ZOQFO165.wav
Are you CRAZY?! What about the Frungy Championships!?
#(GENERAL_INFO_22)	ZOQFO166.wav
Why should we tell the Earth Captain about that?
He wouldn't be interested.
#(GENERAL_INFO_23)	ZOQFO167.wav
Oh, yeah? How do you know?
#(GENERAL_INFO_24)	ZOQFO168.wav
Because I'M not even interested.
Nobody with any brains is interested in Frungy!
#(GENERAL_INFO_25)	ZOQFO169.wav
Well what about me, huh?
I LOVE Frungy! It's the Sport of Kings!
#(GENERAL_INFO_26)	ZOQFO170.wav
  
#(GENERAL_INFO_27)	ZOQFO171.wav
Oh, all right
he wouldn't know any of the teams anyway.


#(GENERAL_INFO_30)	ZOQFO172.wav
Although this may not pertain to the Ur-Quan
we have received an interesting report
from one of our deep space scouts.
#(GENERAL_INFO_31)	ZOQFO173.wav
She found a strange metal door-thing
embedded in the surface of an alien planet.
#(GENERAL_INFO_32)	ZOQFO174.wav
Although she and her crew spent many days
trying to open the door
#(GENERAL_INFO_33)	ZOQFO175.wav
they failed utterly to so much as budge it.
#(GENERAL_INFO_34)	ZOQFO176.wav
The reported location of this alien artifact
is Epsilon Camelopardalis I-A.
#(GENERAL_INFO_35)	ZOQFO177.wav
Go open it!
I bet there's something cool inside!

#(GENERAL_INFO_40)	ZOQFO178.wav
We may not have told you this before, Captain
but my species is somewhat sensitive
to certain meta-psychic vibrations.
#(GENERAL_INFO_41)	ZOQFO179.wav
Oh, no! Not this mental stuff again!
#(GENERAL_INFO_42)	ZOQFO180.wav
Although my friend's species
has difficulty understanding our powers
I can guarantee you, Captain
that our limited abilities are quite real.
#(GENERAL_INFO_43)	ZOQFO181.wav
Oh, yeah! Remember that time
you said you could fix our broken chronometers
with your `sympathetic psionic waves'?
More like `pathetic waves' if you ask me!
Nyark! Nyark! Nyark!
#(GENERAL_INFO_44)	ZOQFO182.wav
Even through all this negative energy, Captain
we have discovered that...
#(GENERAL_INFO_45)	ZOQFO183.wav
...and THEN there was the time
you said you could bend dorfs with just your...
#(GENERAL_INFO_46)	ZOQFO184.wav
SHUT UP!
#(GENERAL_INFO_47)	ZOQFO185.wav
...sorry.
#(GENERAL_INFO_48)	ZOQFO186.wav
As I was saying, before I was so RUDELY interrupted!...
#(GENERAL_INFO_49)	ZOQFO187.wav
I said I was sorry.
#(GENERAL_INFO_410)	ZOQFO188.wav
Our most talented Seers have detected
some ominous and powerful meta-psychic signals
from the direction of the Orionis constellation.
#(GENERAL_INFO_411)	ZOQFO189.wav
Faker.


#(any_war_news)
Any news about the war between the two alien races?

#(UTWIG_DELAY0)	ZOQFO190.wav
Our scouts have witnessed an exciting event
in the Horologii star system.
#(UTWIG_DELAY1)	ZOQFO191.wav
Yeah! Big news!
#(UTWIG_DELAY2)	ZOQFO192.wav
Two alien races have entered that region of space
from the coreward direction.
#(UTWIG_DELAY3)	ZOQFO193.wav
One of the races looks like big talkin' weeds
and the other wears a funny mask.
#(UTWIG_DELAY4)	ZOQFO194.wav
And they are attacking our enemies!
#(UTWIG_DELAY5)	ZOQFO195.wav
Well, ONE of our enemies, anyway.
#(UTWIG_DELAY6)	ZOQFO196.wav
Yes, the new aliens seem to be confining their hostilities
to the sinister Kohr-Ah.
#(UTWIG_DELAY7)	ZOQFO197.wav
Actually, that's good news.
#(UTWIG_DELAY8)	ZOQFO198.wav
By focusing on the Kohr-Ah
who have been winning their war up to this point
#(UTWIG_DELAY9)	ZOQFO199.wav
They've been plastering the Ur-Quan.
#(UTWIG_DELAY10)	ZOQFO200.wav
The balance of power has been equalized somewhat
#(UTWIG_DELAY11)	ZOQFO201.wav
But the Kohr-Ah will STILL probably win!
#(UTWIG_DELAY12)	ZOQFO202.wav
But we estimate that the efforts of these new alien races
has delayed the Kohr-Ah's eventual victory
by nine to twelve months.
#(UTWIG_DELAY13)	ZOQFO203.wav
Still, it's better than nothing!

#(KOHRAH_WINNING0)	ZOQFO204.wav
We have modified a few of our Stinger starships
for long-range reconnaissance missions.
#(KOHRAH_WINNING1)	ZOQFO205.wav
We strapped a bunch of fuel tanks on their hulls.
#(KOHRAH_WINNING2)	ZOQFO206.wav
The scouts were ordered to investigate the progress of the war
between the green ships, who we now know as the `Ur-Quan'
and the black ships, flown by the `Kohr-Ah'.
#(KOHRAH_WINNING3)	ZOQFO207.wav
We sent out ten... two came back
#(KOHRAH_WINNING4)	ZOQFO208.wav
But the information they gathered was worth the cost.
#(KOHRAH_WINNING5)	ZOQFO209.wav
Unless you were one of the scouts, I suppose?
Nyark! Nyark! Nyark!
#(KOHRAH_WINNING6)	ZOQFO210.wav
SHUT UP!
#(KOHRAH_WINNING7)	ZOQFO211.wav
...sorry.
#(KOHRAH_WINNING8)	ZOQFO212.wav
Anyway, as I was saying, the intelligence they gathered
indicates that the Kohr-Ah will win their war
sometime near the beginning of the year 2158.
#(KOHRAH_WINNING9)	ZOQFO213.wav
Unless someone evens up the alien forces
by destroying about a bazillion Kohr-Ah ships.


#(URQUAN_NEARLY_GONE0)	ZOQFO214.wav
Our reconnaissance ships have returned once more
#(URQUAN_NEARLY_GONE1)	ZOQFO215.wav
With bad news.
#(URQUAN_NEARLY_GONE2)	ZOQFO216.wav
Based on what they have seen
the Kohr-Ah will defeat the Ur-Quan
in less than six months.
#(URQUAN_NEARLY_GONE3)	ZOQFO217.wav
Bummer.
#(URQUAN_NEARLY_GONE4)	ZOQFO218.wav
And based on our last encounter with the Kohr-Ah
we expect that when they win their war with the Ur-Quan
the Kohr-Ah will move through this entire region of space
destroying all intelligent life.
#(URQUAN_NEARLY_GONE5)	ZOQFO219.wav
Major bummer!

#(KOHRAH_FRENZY0)	ZOQFO220.wav
I fear we have received our last scouting reports, Captain.
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY1)	ZOQFO221.wav
Poor Yip, Tun and Haffy! I'll really miss those guys!
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY2)	ZOQFO222.wav
Although none of our scouts returned home alive
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY3)	ZOQFO223.wav
...and Jiff... and Fod... and (sniff!)...
...my best pal, Rogi!
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY4)	ZOQFO224.wav
They were able to send a last message.
The Kohr-Ah have won their war against the Ur-Quan
and they have begun their hideous death march.
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY5)	ZOQFO225.wav
(sniff!)
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY6)	ZOQFO226.wav
The only piece of knowledge we have
that may help you defeat them
is a fragment of a transmission we received
from our agent Buppo who was in the Crateris constellation.
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY7)	ZOQFO227.wav
They got Buppo too?!...(SOB!)
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY8)	ZOQFO228.wav
He reported that the Kohr-Ah had something
`big, dangerous and important as hell'
in one of the nearby star systems.
That was all we got before Buppo's signal was cut off.
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY9)	ZOQFO229.wav
(SOB!)
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY10)	ZOQFO230.wav
You have got to stop the Kohr-Ah, Captain!...
...before they kill us all.
#(KOHRAH_FRENZY11)	ZOQFO231.wav
(sniff!)


#(NO_WAR_NEWS0)	ZOQFO232.wav
No. We have nothing new to report.
#(NO_WAR_NEWS1)	ZOQFO233.wav
Nope! Not a thing.


#(i_want_alliance)
I have travelled here to seek an alliance between our peoples.

#(GOOD0)	ZOQFO234.wav
How wonderful! We accept!
#(GOOD1)	ZOQFO235.wav
Hurray!
#(GOOD2)	ZOQFO236.wav
How marvelous!
#(GOOD3)	ZOQFO237.wav
Yee-ha!
#(GOOD4)	ZOQFO238.wav
Captain, we are delighted that your people have made this choice!
#(GOOD5)	ZOQFO239.wav
Now WE won't get slaughtered!
#(GOOD6)	ZOQFO240.wav
In exchange for our cooperation helping you with captains and ship designs
all that we ask for is your protection.
#(GOOD7)	ZOQFO241.wav
So we don't get slaughtered!
#(GOOD8)	ZOQFO242.wav
We shall begin fulfilling our commitment at once!
We will transport officers and our Stinger design to your base immediately!
#(GOOD9)	ZOQFO243.wav
Why, heck!
Maybe I'll even make the trip to your planet!
I'd make a good starship captain, Captain!
I'm pretty darn mean in a fight
and there ain't nobody better than me
with a thrusting stinger tongue attack!

#(want_specific_info)
I would like some specific information.

#(WHAT_SPECIFIC_INFO0)	ZOQFO244.wav
Sure. What do you want to know?
#(WHAT_SPECIFIC_INFO1)	ZOQFO245.wav
Just ask away!

#(enough_info)
That's enough info for now, thanks!

#(OK_ENOUGH_INFO)	ZOQFO246.wav
Anything else?

#(what_about_others)
What do you know about other alien races?

#(ABOUT_OTHERS0)	ZOQFO247.wav
Not much, to tell the truth.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS1)	ZOQFO248.wav
This space exploration stuff is kinda new to us.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS2)	ZOQFO249.wav
Besides the green alien ships...
#(ABOUT_OTHERS3)	ZOQFO250.wav
Which have only tried to kill us.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS4)	ZOQFO251.wav
...and the black alien ships...
#(ABOUT_OTHERS5)	ZOQFO252.wav
Which have actually been QUITE SUCCESSFUL at killing us.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS6)	ZOQFO253.wav
The only other starships we have encountered
are strange tumbling red probes
which profess to be on a peaceful mission
#(ABOUT_OTHERS7)	ZOQFO254.wav
But then attack like slavering Zebrankys.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS8)	ZOQFO255.wav
We believe that the probes are actually robotic scouts
which have suffered some kind of malfunction
resulting in their aberrant behavior.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS9)	ZOQFO256.wav
And what's worse, they are multiplying.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS10)	ZOQFO257.wav
Yes, that's true.
The probes seem to be replicating at a geometric rate.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS11)	ZOQFO258.wav
AIEE! That means if there was only one last week
then next month... ah
wait a minute... let me calculate
uh
uh
uh
That means, next month there will be
...A WHOLE MESS OF THOSE THINGS!
#(ABOUT_OTHERS12)	ZOQFO259.wav
By back-tracing the probes' course paths
we have been able to calculate
that the source of the probes
is somewhere on a direct line
that includes our star, and Epsilon Muscae.
#(ABOUT_OTHERS13)	ZOQFO260.wav
Go get 'em, Captain!

#(what_about_zebranky)
Tell me more about your people.

#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY0)	ZOQFO261.wav
Ah! Cultural exchange. A good idea.
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY1)	ZOQFO262.wav
Yeah! Let's tell him about Frungy!
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY2)	ZOQFO263.wav
Be quiet, you fool! He asked a serious question!
He doesn't want to know about Frungy.
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY3)	ZOQFO264.wav
How do you know? What makes you so smart?
You never even asked him if he wants to know about Frungy.
Why, I'll bet right now he's wondering
`What is this wonderful sport, Frungy?', `How is it played?'
`What kind of equipment do you need to play Frungy?'
and `I wonder who's ahead in the Frungy Championships?'
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY4)	ZOQFO265.wav
AUGH! Will you just SHUT UP ABOUT FRUNGY?!
If you say another word about that STUPID GAME
I'm going to lose control and blow a cloud of spores at you!
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY5)	ZOQFO266.wav
Yech! Okay, okay. Don't blow your sac.
I won't mention Frungy again, I promise.
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY6)	ZOQFO267.wav
Well, Captain, as you can probably see
our culture's predominant trait
its greatest strength AND weakness
is the diverse interactions between Zoq, Fot, and Pik.
#(ABOUT_ZEBRANKY7)	ZOQFO268.wav
FRUNGY! FRUNGY! FRUNGY!

#(what_about_past)
What was your history like?

#(ABOUT_PAST0)	ZOQFO269.wav
Our past? Quite a broad topic for this short conversation
but we'll share a key piece of our history with you.
#(ABOUT_PAST1)	ZOQFO270.wav
After we killed off the last Zebranky
we faced an interesting question.
#(ABOUT_PAST2)	ZOQFO271.wav
Should we proceed, and establish a culture
which would advance in art, technology and social sophistication?...
#(ABOUT_PAST3)	ZOQFO272.wav
...Or should we just go back into the forest
and kick back and enjoy ourselves
knowing that a Zebranky wasn't gonna jump out of a bush and eat us!
#(ABOUT_PAST4)	ZOQFO273.wav
Well, we DID go back into the forest.
We stayed there for about five thousand years and had a great time
#(ABOUT_PAST5)	ZOQFO274.wav
Then, one stormy day, a Zoq, a Fot, and a Pik were walking up a steep path
looking for something good to eat, when a bolt of lightning struck nearby.
With a huge flash of light, the bolt of energy
carved a strangely-shaped chunk of granite out of a cliff.
#(ABOUT_PAST6)	ZOQFO275.wav
It was a disk, with a hole in the middle!
As the rock began to roll down the hill, toward the three terrified beings
some dry grass got caught in its hole, and since the rock was still hot
the grass caught on fire.
#(ABOUT_PAST7)	ZOQFO276.wav
When the rock finally got to the Zoq, the Fot, and the Pik
they simultaneously discovered the Wheel, Fire, and Religion
thus catapulting them on to the road of progress
#(ABOUT_PAST8)	ZOQFO277.wav
Which has led us to this day, Captain.
Oh! How did the flaming wheel give religion to our Culture, you ask?
#(ABOUT_PAST9)	ZOQFO278.wav
I will explain.
You see, when it got to the threesome, the flaming wheel was going at a pretty good clip
and it ran smack into the Zoq, killing him.
#(ABOUT_PAST10)	ZOQFO279.wav
The Fot and the Pik felt so bad
they really liked that Zoq!...
...that they decided the Zoq hadn't really died when the wheel flattened him
he had just gone to `a better place.'
#(ABOUT_PAST11)	ZOQFO280.wav
Presumably one without lethal flaming wheels.

#(what_about_stinger)
Can you describe your `Stinger' starship?

#(ABOUT_STINGER0)	ZOQFO281.wav
The Stinger is the peak of our technological prowess.
#(ABOUT_STINGER1)	ZOQFO282.wav
It's totally awesome!
#(ABOUT_STINGER2)	ZOQFO283.wav
These vessels are cheap to build
and can be quite effective in short range combat.
#(ABOUT_STINGER3)	ZOQFO284.wav
They turn on a... on a
well a small round thing that's REAL small!
#(ABOUT_STINGER4)	ZOQFO285.wav
Remember though, against most ships
the Stinger must close distance immediately
and give unrelenting tongue attacks
until either the enemy or the Stinger are destroyed.
#(ABOUT_STINGER5)	ZOQFO286.wav
Yeah! The tonguing is the best part!


#(what_about_guy_in_back)
Does that guy in back ever say anything?

#(ABOUT_GUY0)	ZOQFO287.wav
Nope.
#(ABOUT_GUY1)	ZOQFO288.wav
Not a word.
