"With a flare of incandescent light, the slave shield vanished..."
"...and for the first time in my life I saw the true colors of Earth..."
"...blues and greens in a thousand different shades."
"As we watched, we could see the first signs of ships coming up from Earth."
"They lifted from the planet's surface to join us in space."
"The destiny of Mankind had been delayed for over twenty years..."
"...but now our world was free and nothing could stop us!"
"I stayed in that hospital for almost a month..."
"...but that day..."
"...that day I watched the shield fall and beautiful Talana stood at my side..."
"I'll never forget that day. Not for the rest of my life..."
