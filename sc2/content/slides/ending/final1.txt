"And following the destruction of the Sa-Matra battle platform..."
"...the fleets of the Ur-Quan and the Kohr-Ah had fallen into chaos..."
"...and had been vanquished by Chmmr forces and allied starships."
"Then Talana told me to sit up."
"She said there was something she thought I'd like to see..."
