# Keyboard control definitions follow this point.  Most keys can be
# described in a straightforward manner; consult the name table in
# src/sc2code/libs/input/sdl/keynames.c for the names of unusual keys.
# Most keys can be named by just the symbol they produce.

# Menu controls.  Both sets of arrow keys, basically.  Paging controls
# moving quickly through the file lists in Super Melee.  Zooming
# controls zoom controls in the starmap.  "Cancel" is also used to get
# you into menu mode to begin with.  There is a "Menu-Special" command
# currently unused by the game.  It seems to have been originally used
# to call up details on starships in the Super Melee selection screen.

# This is a sample joystick configuration.  This is intended to work
# primarily under WinXP with a USB analog/digital gamepad.  The
# digital aspect of the gamepad happens to present itself to the
# system as a POV hat.  This configuration allows either the digital
# or analog stick to be used simultaneously.  More importantly, it
# gives us a chance to give examples for all of the various input types
# that UQM can handle.
