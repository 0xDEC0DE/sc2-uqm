# File format:
# Three lines for Pause Key, Exit Key, Abort Key
# 9 lines for player 1, 9 lines for player 2 in the following order:
# Left, Right, Up, Down, Button 1, Button 2, Button 3, 
# Left Shift, Right Shift
#
# Each player's key listing can begin with an optional joystick declaration
# of the format:
# <JoyportX-thresholdT> where X is the joystick port (0-based) and T is the
# threshold.  Digital pads can use a threshold of 0, but analog joysticks
# may need a non-zero threshold to handle jittering
# 
# Lines beginning with a '#' are ignored
# Each line contains one or two entries
# The first entry must be a keyboard key, enclosed in quotes
# Use "Up" for up arrow, "Down" for down arrow, etc.
# You can chord keys together like this: "F2,F3"
# The second entry, if present, will be separated from the first entry by a
# space.  It represents a joystick button press / axis motion
# The format for joystick button presses is
# <Joy-Bn> where n is the button number
# The format for joystick axis movement is
# <Joy-An+> or <Joy-An-> where n is the axis number, and the
# + or - represents the direction of movement
# You can combine two joystick button presses with
# <Joy-Cn,m> where n and m are button numbers
