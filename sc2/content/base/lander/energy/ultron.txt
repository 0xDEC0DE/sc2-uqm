#(ULTRON 1)
     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

THE ORBITAL BOMBARDMENT WAS RATHER COMPLETE HERE, CAPTAIN. NOT MUCH HAS SURVIVED OF THE SUPOX CIVILIZATION.

LUCKILY, WHILE DIGGING IN A RANDOM PILE OF FERTILIZER, ENSIGN MARTIN FOUND A CRATE CONTAINING A STRANGE DEVICE. THE SHIPPING MANIFEST STATES THIS 'ULTRON' WAS RECEIVED FROM A NEARBY RACE IN THE AQUARII CLUSTER. THE DEVICE APPEARS TO BE BROKEN AND MISSING SOME PARTS, BUT MAYBE THE TECHS BACK AT THE BASE CAN TAKE A WHACK AT IT.

WE ARE RETURNING TO THE SHIP WITH THE DEVICE.

        ---- END OF REPORT ----
#(ULTRON 2)
     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

CAPTAIN, WE HAVE DUG THROUGH THE MANURE-ENCRUSTED SUPOX RUINS ONCE AGAIN, BROKEN THREE SHOVELS, AND FOUND NOTHING MORE OF VALUE.

        ---- END OF REPORT ----
