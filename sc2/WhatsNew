This file tries to organize and describe the changes between releases.
Changes are broadly classified into the following categories:

- New Features: These are either elements of the original games that
  were first implemented in this release, or actually new capabilities
  that are visible to the user.

- Bugfixes: The removal of visible Bad Things from the code.

- Internal Changes: The removal of invisible Bad Things from the code,
  or changes in the way the program itself is structured.  These are
  unlikely to be of interest to you unless you plan on coding
  extensions.

			     Version 0.2
			    -------------

NEW FEATURES

- Planet info "coarse scan" information available and properly rendered,
  either in 3DO way (symbols) or PC (text)
- 3D spinning planet in orbit window is present, with antialiasing and
  phong lighting and an animated approach
- Pixel-perfect collision detection; Spathi/Mycon are thus playable, and
  the game is now beatable
- Build system enhanced and generalized to handle OpenBSD and FreeBSD cleanly.
- Oscilloscope display works in communication now
- Color-shading in planet scans
- Earth with its slave shield now functions properly
- Outfit Starship and Shipyard graphics re-extracted
- Save data and temp files are put in a separate directory now
- Star sizes and colors are properly differentiated.
- Planet surface is smoothed, blurred, and randomized slightly when it's
  magnified
- SIS Status window fully implemented (including gradiated fonts from PC
  version)
- Dialogue "slider" shows how far along the speech is; rewind/forward works
- 'ESC' alone lets you emergency-warp-escape
- Optional PC version menus
- Preliminary support for MacOS X (needs more work)

BUGFIXES

- Melee screens cleaned up, SuperMelee menus work.
- Subtitles now render for all alien races
- Major editing of subtitles to match more closely the speeches
- Speech and subtitles are now synchronized properly
- Autopilot indicator doesn't take over the top of the screen anymore.
- Entering star systems on autopilot doesn't crash the system.
- Planet scan is properly erased when cancelling/landing
- Initial display of planet surface on landing is at correct position
- Spheres of influence now move correctly on the starmap
- Melnorme correctly compute the required additional credits
- Team names switching when selecting the next ship to fight in melee fixed
- Commas left dots behind on planetary reports; this is fixed
- Screen resets properly after loading/saving
- Dialog choices wrap properly
- Precursor ship crew count now placed correctly in melee
- 'Cued' color transforms in conversations occur at the right time now
- SIS correctly predicts its own fuel usage now
- Melnorme no longer give away fuel
- Flagship modules are properly aligned
- The PC soundtrack now loops correctly
- Lander upgrades were drawn incorrectly
- Autopilot now works in QuasiSpace without fuel
- Captain portraits in melee are updated properly now
- If you have over 1000 units of a resource, those numbers are properly
  cleared

INTERNAL CHANGES

- SDL_mixer has been abandoned in favor of either OpenAL or the new
  "MixSDL" library built on the basic SDL_audio routines
- Color transforms in communications are merged into the core animation
  thread now, improving speed and stability
- Much more flexible handling of commandline options
- All allocated memory is allocated through 'safe' routines that abort if
  the allocation fails.
- Thread library now includes condition variables
- Threads can tell the rendering thread to sleep until everything they've
  requested is done
- The rendering thread has been recoded to use no heap space and to have a
  far smaller memory footprint.
- Added a special #define, DCQ_OF_DOOM, which simulates severe overload 
  stresses.
- SAI and related scalers removed due to GPL incompatibilities; similar
  algorithms reimplemented under GPL.
- Files for the intro and ending sequence have been successfully extracted
- Rendering thread routines are somewhat more modular than before
- Created a new set of graphics primitives that's much easier to use
- Only parts of the screen that actually changed are updated
- Input code rewritten entirely
- Various functions have their names changed to avoid conflicts with
  core library routines on OS X
