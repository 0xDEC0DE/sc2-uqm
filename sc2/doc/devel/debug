The file src/sc2code/uqmdebug.c and src/sc2code/uqmdebug.h contain various
debugging functions, which are included in the binary when the game
is built in debug mode.
These functions can be called from anywhere in the code, though some
require the game to be in a specific state.
The function debugKeyPressed() in uqmdebug.c is called when the debug key
is pressed. This function is a suitable place to put various debugging
calls.
The debug key can be specified in keys.cfg by adding a line with a text
similar to "Debug: key F11".
An interactive way to access various debugging code, similar to
the uio debug mode (see below) is in the works.

The most interesting debugging functionality available at the moment is
listed below:
- the function equipShip()
  When this function is called, the SIS is equiped with various useful
  modules (a possible Precursor Bomb is left in place), all
  fuel tanks and crew pods are filled to the maximum, you are given
  the maximum number of landers, and all possible lander shields are
  installed.
- the boolean variable instantMove
  When this variable is set to TRUE, you can select a location on the
  star map, and your HyperSpace/Quasispace coordinates will immediately
  be set to them. Your realspace coordinates are not changed, so if you
  are exploring a solar system, you'll only notice it when you leave to
  HyperSpace.
- the function showSpheres()
  When this function is called, all spheres of influence of the active
  races will be shown.
- the function forwardToNextEvent()
  Fast forwards the clock until the next event. If TRUE is given as an
  argument, the HYPERSPACE_ENCOUNTER_EVENTs, which normally happen every
  day, are skipped.
- the function dumpEvents()
  Outputs information on all scheduled events to a FILE.
- the function dumpPlanetTypes()
  Outputs information on all planet types to a FILE.
- the function dumpStars()
  Outputs information on all stars to a FILE.
  With the 'flags' variable, the amount of detail can be specified.
  At this time this function will only work when called from the top of
  ExploreSolarSys(). Defining DUMP_STARS in sc2code/uqmdebug.h
  will make this happen.
- the function uio_debugInteractive()
  This function is not defined in sc2code/uqmdebug.h, but in libs/uio.h.
  This function can interactively (tty-based) display information on
  the state of the uio file system, and modifications can be made.
