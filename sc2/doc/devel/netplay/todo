High priority items:
- test compilation on release mode (on both Linux and Windows)


Medium-priority:
- Test disconnection at various points.
  Whenever there's a call to NetInput(), connections may get lost, and
  this needs to be checked.
- Setup menu for network options.
- Don't check PlayerControl in netmelee etc. Make it an invariant that
  (netConnections[player] != NULL) if
  ((PlayerControl[player] & NETWORK_CONTROL) == NETWORK_CONTROL)
- For the battle ending synchronisation, set the end at at least
  getBattleInputDelay() + 1 frames in the future (instead of just 1),
  so that there will be no hickup during the end synchronisation.
  Also check this value for incoming packets.
- Disconnect notification.
- If a player only moves away from 'Battle!' there's no need for the other
  to have to reconfirm.
- decent pause handling
- make compilation of crc.c and checksum.c conditional.
- negotiate checksum interval
- disconnect during battle will trigger the setup disconnect notification.


Low-priority:
- Different coloured icons for unconnected/connecting/connected.
- Send error packets; at least when there's a protocol version mismatch.
- Check whether the random seed and frame delay have been agreed before
  continuing (in doConfirmSettings).
- Replacement for TOS. It is IPv4 only.
- Integrate network check functions with doInput
  It will be easy to get rid of the separate threads then too.
- The state changes from interBattle to interBattle. That shouldn't happen,
  but it doesn't seem to cause any problems. Need to investigate.
  Addition: negotiateReadyConnections() is called again just to make sure
  all sides pass this checkpoint. This is not a problem. It should be
  documented in STATES though.
- More files define NETCONNECTION_INTERNAL than they should.
- voice transmission during the game (using an external lib)
  read ramjee94adaptive.pdf
- Keep-alive packets. Store time of last packet sent, use alarms to determine
  when to send the next one. Count received messages?


Future improvements/optimisations:
- For BSD sockets: use dup2() to move fds to lower values, so that less fds
  have to be checked on select().
- Use writev() to send multiple packets in one syscall, instead of
  calling send() for each packet.
- Refusing games with both parties network controlled is not always
  necessary. In theory it should be possible to have a client work
  as "proxy". The client can watch as the actual players play the game.
  Checking for "loops" would be tricky (eventually there should be a human
  or computer controller for each side).
- Concurrent selection of ships. Note that if this is handled properly, it
  will also be easy to take care of the "Allow Shofixti to choose last" bug.
  Note that one party will still have to send his choice to the other side
  first, which may be "eploited". Encryption would take care of this,
  but at the least make sure the same player who gets to chose first
  every time.
- meta-server. Use HTTP? Existing libs can be used, no problems with NAT,
  human-readable. Speed is not an issue.
- move to UDP. Repeat past battleinput packets for each new packet that
  is sent until they are confirmed.


Bugs:
- as positions are dependant on the screen resolution, you won't be able
  to keep sync on games with a different resolution.
- Both sides need identical battle frame rates. This value is not
  negotiated.
- When melee selection is aborted, the game crashes.


Final actions:
- Check out TODO, XXX, WORK tags
- memleak testing
  - check for and remove mtrace()/muntrace() calls.
- update documentation
  - FILES, also note which part of the separation they are in
- check coding style (search for '\>(')
- compile with maximum warnings

When done:
- cvs diff
- Update uqm version number
- Update changelog


To put in the announcement of Netplay:
- Slow connections is acceptable. Packet loss isn't.


Bugs and todos unrelated to netplay.
- When you insert a new ship, the cursor moves to the next square,
  but the picture at the right doesn't change.
- The "Battle!" icon is not positioned correctly.
- other player being able to choose the next ship after 3 seconds
  of inactivity
- DoRunAway() shouldn't be handled in ProcessInput()
