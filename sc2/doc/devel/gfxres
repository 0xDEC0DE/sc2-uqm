This is the format for resources of type GFXRES (these have the extension
.ani in the original source).

Everything is stored MSB first.

           4       Unknown, (0x00000000)
           4       FlagsAndIndex:
                     bits 0-11: 1 less than the number of frames in this
                                graphics resource
                     bits 12-15: flags:

                     bits 16-31: unknown (0x0000)

Frame info:
Then for all frames:
           4       Type index and flags (TypeIndexAndFlags)
                   Low 2 bytes:
                     bits 0-11 is the index of this frame
                     bits 12-15 are the type flags:
                        - bit 12-13:
                          - 0: (ROM_DRAWABLE)
                          - 1: Direct drawable (RAM_DRAWABLE)
                          - 2: (SCREEN_DRAWABLE)
                          - 3: (OVERLAY_DRAWABLE)
                   High 2 bytes (frame flags):
                      - bits 0-7: global PLUT to use
                      - bit 12: (DATA_HARDWARE)
                      - bit 13: (DATA_COPY)
                      - bit 14: (DATA_PACKED)
                      - bit 15: (X_FLIP)
           4       Hot spot information (definition of (0, 0) in the image):
                      - low 2 byes: x location of hot spot
                      - high 2 bytes: y location of hot spot
           4       Image bounds:
                      - low 2 bytes: Image width
                      - low 2 bytes: Image height
           4       Offset from beginning of the frame info for this frame
                   to the beginning of the frame.

Then for all frames:
           4       Size of image data
