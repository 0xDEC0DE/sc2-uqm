This is the format for resources of type STRTAB. It contains a number of
items of unspecified data (not necessarilly strings).
This is used for game strings (extension .txt), colour tables (.ct),
colour translation tables (.xlt), and sound-effect tables (.snd)

Everything is stored MSB first unless otherwise specified.

position   length  meaning
           4       0xffffffff if the file is uncompressed.
                   Otherwise, the file is compressed. When uncompressed, the
                   file complies with the rest of the format as described
                   below.
           2       Unused in file, always 0x0000
           2       number of items in the file (StringCount)

Followed by:
  In file:
           4       Placeholder, always 0x00000000
    numitems times:
           4       length of string
  In memory:
    numitems times:
           4       offset from &StringCount to the string
    followed by:
           4       offset from &StringCount until one char past the end
                   of the last string.


For .ct files an item is as follows:
           1       Index of first clut in this item.
           1       Index of last clut in this item.
  For each item:
    32 palette entries:
           2       bits 0-4: blue value
                   bits 5-9: green value
                   bits 10-15: red value
The full palette contains 256 values, which are the original 32 values
    multiplied by 1 to 8.


For .snd files an item is as follows:
           N-2     Signed, 8-bit, 1 channel PCM samples of the sound
                   effect, where N = (length of string)
           2       Sampling frequency of the sound, *LSB first*
                   (the frequencies themselves seem to be remnants of
                    the DOS version)
