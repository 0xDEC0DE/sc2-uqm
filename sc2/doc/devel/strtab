This is the format for resources of type STRTAB. It contains a number of
items of unspecified data (not necessarilly strings).
This is used for game strings (extension .txt), colour tables (.ct),
and colour translation tables (.xlt).

Everything is stored MSB first unless otherwise specified.

position   length  meaning
           4       Unknown, always 0xffffffff
           2       Unknown, always 0x0000
           2       number of items in the file (StringCount)

Followed by:
  In file:
           4       Placeholder, always 0x00000000
    numitems times:
           4       length of string
  In memory:
    numitems times:
           4       offset from &StringCount to the string
    followed by:
           4       offset from &StringCount until one char past the end
                   of the last string.


For .ct files an item is as follows:
           1       Index of first clut in this item.
           1       Index of last clut in this item.
  For each item:
    32 palette entries:
           2       bits 0-4: blue value
                   bits 5-9: green value
                   bits 10-15: red value
The full palette contains 256 values, which are the original 32 values
    multiplied by 1 to 8.
