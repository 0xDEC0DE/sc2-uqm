	Contains all the ships from the enum from races.h that defines
	NUM_AVAILABLE_RACES.
	Elements are of type EXTENDED_SHIP_FRAGMENT (to become FLEET_INFO).
	It contains information about the various races, not really about
	specific ships.
	Filled in InitSIS().
	Partially included in savegames.

GlobData.Game_state.built_ship_q:
	The fleet accompanying the flagship.
	Elements are of type SHIP_FRAGMENT.
	which_side is always GOOD_GUY here.
	Partially included in savegames.

master_q:
	Queue of all the ships that exist in the game.
	Elements are of type SHIP_FRAGMENT (to become MASTER_SHIP_INFO).
	Sorted on the (abbreviated) race name (see doc/racestrings).

GlobData.Game_state.npc_built_ship_q:
	The npc ships in an encounter, or list of ship groups when in IP;
	  empty otherwise.
	Elements are of type SHIP_FRAGMENT. IP group list will most likely

	For encounters with an infinite number of ships, the queue consists
	of a single ship with ShipInfo.crew_level set to (BYTE)~0.

	Partially included in savegames.
