The various ship queues used in the game:

GlobData.Game_state.avail_race_q:
	Contains all the ships from the enum from races.h that defines
	NUM_AVAILABLE_RACES.
	Elements are of type EXTENDED_SHIP_FRAGMENT.
	It contains information about the various races, not really about
	specific ships.
	Filled in InitSIS().
	RaceDescPtr is an actual pointer, but to EXTENDED_SHIP_INFO
		and not RACE_DESC
	Partially included in savegames.

GlobData.Game_state.built_ship_q:
	The fleet accompanying the flagship.
	Elements are of type SHIP_FRAGMENT.
	RaceDescPtr is abused to store the captain's name index.
	and the side that this ship is on (always GOOD_GUY here).
	Partially included in savegames.

master_q:
	Queue of all the ships that exist in the game.
	Elements are of type SHIP_FRAGMENT.
	Sorted on the (abbreviated) race name (see doc/racestrings).
	Filled in LoadMasterShipList().
	RaceDescPtr is an actual pointer, but to SHIP_INFO and not RACE_DESC

GlobData.Game_state.npc_built_ship_q:
	The npc ships in an encounter. Empty when not in an encounter.
	Elements are of type SHIP_FRAGMENT.
	For encounters with an infinite number of ships, the queue consists
	of a single ship with ShipInfo.crew_level set to (BYTE)~0.
	RaceDescPtr is abused to store the captain's name index.
	and the side that this ship is on.
	Partially included in savegames.

race_q[NUM_PLAYERS]:
	Contains the ships participating in a battle for each player.
	Elements are of type STARSHIP.
	Filled in BuildBattle().
	RaceDescPtr is abused to store the captain's name index,
		until the ship is loaded in spawn_ship(), at which time
		it becomes an actual pointer to RACE_DESC.
	and the side that this ship is on.


Other queues:

GlobData.Game_state.GameClock.event_q:
	Queue of game events.
	Elements are of type EVENT.

disp_q:
	Display queue. This contains all visible elements; everything
	that floats in TrueSpace, HyperSpace/QuasiSpace, battle.
	Elements are of type ELEMENT.

GlobData.Game_state.encounter_q:
	Contains information regarding the black globes flying around
	in HyperSpace.
	Elements are of type ENCOUNTER.
