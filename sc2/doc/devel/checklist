Checklist for releases:
- make a final build in release mode
- make sure the permissions in the .zip files are ok (0644 for data files
  and 0755 for executables and dirs)
- make a new tag for the cvs repository
- for the source archive:
  - use a clean cvs dir.
    'cvs export' will produce a clean structure, without CVS dirs.
    This requires a tag having been created though.
    Just using 'cvs update' and watching the output will not be
    enough, as some files like those beginning with '.#'will be ignored.
