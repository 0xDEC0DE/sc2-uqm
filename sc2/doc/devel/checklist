                    -== Checklist for releases ==-


Preparing for the release:
- update the 'version' file in the content dir
- update 'uqmversion.h'
- update uqm.lsm (needs to be done after the content packages are generated)
- test on all relevant platforms
- make sure the documentation files are up-to-date
  - Clean up the ChangeLog file
  - generate Whatsnew from the ChangeLog
  - doc/users/manual.txt
  - doc/users/unixinstall
  - Contributing
  - AUTHORS
  - INSTALL
  - unix man pages (in the future)


Building the release:
- make a new tag for the cvs repository
- make a final build in release mode
- for the source archive:
  - use a clean cvs dir.
    'cvs export' will produce a clean structure, without CVS dirs.
    This requires a tag having been created though.
    Just using 'cvs update' and watching the output will not be
    enough, as some files like those beginning with '.#'will be ignored.
- Building the content packages:
  - make sure the permissions in the .zip files are ok (0644 for data files
    and 0755 for executables and dirs)
  - don't compress .ogg files


Announcing the release:
- provide md5 sums for the released files
- add a new entry for the release in the bugs database
- update the home page
  - news
  - download
- send a mail to sc2-announce


Moving on to the next version:
- update the snapshots page so that content diffs are generated to the
  most recent release
