This document describes the installation procedure for a installation from
source on a Linux or BSD platform.

1.
First, make sure all the required libraries are installed.
They are listed in the file INSTALL in the top dir.

2.
If you haven't done so already, download a content .tgz package from
where you got this source package.
Unpack the content .tgz package in the top dir of the source tree
(the dir with (among others) COPYING, src/, build.vars.in):
Something like 'tar -xvzf /path/to/uqm-0.1-content.tgz'.

3.
Run './build.sh uqm'
Change settings in the menu if you want.

4.
Run './build.sh uqm install', and be patient.
Depending on what location you selected in the configuration menu, you might
need root permissions here.

5.
Done.
If you compiled with debug on, you'll have an executable 'uqm-debug' in
the dir you specified, otherwise, it will be named 'uqm'.


If you want to recompile with other options, you can use
'./build.sh uqm config' to reconfigure; you might need to do
'./build.sh uqm depend' afterwards.
