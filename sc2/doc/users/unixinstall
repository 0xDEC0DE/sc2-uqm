This document describes the install procedure for a installation from source
on a Linux or BSD platform.

First, make sure all the required libraries are installed.
They are listed in the file INSTALL in the top dir.

Run './build.sh uqm'
Change settings in the menu if you want.

That's all.

You can use './build.sh uqm config' to reconfigure; you might need to do
'./build.sh uqm depend' afterwards.
