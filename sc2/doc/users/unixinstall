This document describes the installation procedure for a installation from
source on a Linux or BSD platform.

1.
First, make sure all the required libraries are installed.
They are listed in the file INSTALL in the top dir.

2.
If you haven't done so already, download the content .zip files packages
that you want, from where you got this source package.
You'll need uqm-0.2-content.zip; uqm-0.2-3domusic.zip (music from the 3DO
version) and uqm-0.2-voice.zip (spoken alien dialogs) are optional.
Create a 'content' dir in the top of the source tree (the dir with
(among others) COPYING, src/, build.vars.in), and unpack those .zip
files there.
Something like 'unzip /path/to/uqm-0.2-content.zip'.

3.
Run './build.sh uqm'
Change settings in the menu if you want.

4.
Run './build.sh uqm install', and be patient.
Depending on what location you selected in the configuration menu, you might
need root permissions here.

5.
Done.
You can start the game now with the command 'uqm'.


If you want to recompile with other options, you can use
'./build.sh uqm config' to reconfigure; you might need to do
'./build.sh uqm depend' afterwards.
