THE UR-QUAN MASTERS v0.2 alpha -- homepage: http://sc2.sf.net/

Welcome to the second release of the Ur-Quan Masters port.  This
document will tell you everything you need to play, even if you've
never played the original.

For those of you who have played the original, read the first section
(starting the game) and the last section (control summary), and you'll
be good to go.

STARTING THE GAME

Simply invoke the executable from the directory you installed UQM in
to run the game.  (Under Windows, this is uqm.exe; under Linux, it's
uqm.)  This will use the default settings, which are 3DO music,
640x480 windowed mode, and pure SDL graphics drivers.  You may pass
various command line options to customize your experience:

	-r 320x240   (or --res)

Sets the screen resolution.  Unless --opengl is set, the only valid
values are 640x480 and 320x240

	-d 24         (or --bpp)

Sets the color depth.  If you don't set this, the game should
autodetect an appropriate value.  Valid values are 16, 24, and 32.

	-f           (or --fullscreen)

Uses full screen mode.  Pretty straightforward.  Usually good to
combine with -r 320x240.

	-o           (or --opengl)

Use OpenGL drivers.  This produces higher-quality graphics, and may be
faster as well -- but it also may not work on older cards.

	-c           (or --scale=mode)

Graphics scaling mode (bilinear, biadapt or biadv). Default is none.
Try these to get smoother graphics with cost on performance.

	-b           (or --meleescale=mode)

Melee scaling mode (nearest or trilinear). Default is trilinear.
Slower machine owners can set it to nearest to get better performance
in melee but degraded visual quality.

	-s           (or --scanlines)

Simulates interlaced displays.

	-g           (or --gamma)

Sets gamma correction. 1.0 causes no change (unless your graphics card
is originally set to a different value). Higher than 1.0 makes the
image brighter, lower than 1.0 makes it darker.

	-p           (or --fps)

Print fps information in the status window.

	-n           (or --contentdir)

Set the directory where the game will seek its data.

	-h           (or --help)

Display a help message.

	-M           (or --musicvol)

Set music volume (0-100).

	-S           (or --sfxvol)

Set sound effects volume (0-100).

	-T           (or --speechvol)

Set speech volume (0-100). If set to 0, game runs in 'no speech' mode and 
oscilloscope reacts to the music.

	-m 3do       (or --3domusic)

Use the 3DO remixed soundtrack for songs that were in fact remixed.
The default.

	-m pc        (or --pcmusic)

Use the .MOD based PC soundtrack everywhere.

	-q           (or --audioquality)

Can be "high", "medium", or "low".  Specifies how nice the audio
sounds.  Slower machines should lower the audio quality.

	--sound      (no short version)

Can be "openal", "mixsdl" or "none". Specifies which driver/mixer
to use. "openal" is only available when it has been compiled in.
It may produce higher-quality sound and will probably be faster,
but it is not very stable on linux platforms, and may not work
well with some sound cards.
Use "none" as a last resort if you cannot get other drivers to work,
or if you have no soundcard.

	-u           (or --nosubtitles)
	
Disables subtitles.

	--cscan pc

Use PC style planet information when scanning (text).

	--cscan 3do

Use 3DO style planet information when scanning (pictograms).
Default.

	--menu pc

Use PC style menus (text).

	--menu 3do

Use 3DO style menus (pictograms).
Default.

	--font pc

Use PC style fonts and colors.
Default.

	--font 3do

Use 3DO style fonts and colors.

	--scroll pc
Scroll voice-over/subtitles 1 page at a time when using left/right arrow keys
Default.

	--scroll 3do
Scroll voice-over/subtitles smoothly while holding down left/right arrow keys

			     BUG REPORTS

This is an alpha release.  That means several things.  First, it means
that you're an alpha tester.  Be proud.  Second, it means that the
game is likely to crash with great frequency.  Upon finding a problem,
we'd like you to report it, but before you do, please do the following:

- Try to isolate what causes it: "Crashes with a null dereference
  about half the time when firing and taunting with a Pkunk" is better
  than "Melee doesn't work."  If the game crashes, notice what error
  is produced; if the game hangs, check to see if the game-exit key
  (F12) works.

- Go to the bug database at http://uqm.stack.nl/cgi-bin/bugs/index.cgi
  and post a report of the problem there. Search the database first if
  it has been already posted; if we get many duplicate reports, processing
  them eats our time from actual development. If it's been reported, and
  you have more information, feel free to confirm that you've reproduced it
  by adding a comment to the report. If ten people have already confirmed it,
  though, it's probably best to treat it as duly reported.

- Whenever possible, for bugs that only occur under certain conditions,
  include a save game with your bug report that duplicates the bug.
  In the case of a crash, a stack trace can be very helpful for us too.
  If you don't know what a stack trace is, don't worry about it.

- If your issue is more like "support request" than bug report and you
  want help from other users, then posting it to our forum might be
  more appropriate: http://uqm.stack.nl/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.pl



			   THE STORY SO FAR

For the past decade, Earth and the rest of the Alliance of Free Stars
has fought the Ur-Quan and their Hierarchy of Battle Thralls.  In the
course of the War, the Earthlings discovered a factory world by the
'Precursors' - an impossibly advanced that disappeared tens of
thousands of years ago.  This colony, Unzervalt (aka Vela I), lost all
contact with Earth shortly after landfall.

You are Captain Zelnick, a human that was born on Unzervalt and who
possesses a remarkable knack for Precursor technology.  You were the
one who worked out how to activate the Precursor installation.

It was a factory for building starships.  However, Unzervalt is
mineral-poor, and there were not enough materials available to
construct a complete vessel.  Your task is to command this craft, the
Vindicator, and return to Earth to tell them of the abandoned colony.
Also, if the War with the Ur-Quan continues, you must fight for Earth
and the Alliance as best you can.

There is a great deal more to this story.  Asking Starbase Commander
Hayes for background information will give you most of it.

		      INTERPLANETARY EXPLORATION

When in a Solar system, use the thrust and steering controls to move
about the system.  Intersecting a planet will move you to the
planetary system; flying over a planet or moon will then put you into
orbit.  From there you can talk to the inhabitants, or, if the planet
is uninhabited, send a lander down to gather minerals, investigate
energy readings, or capture life forms.

			    PLANET LANDING

To land on a planet, you need to achieve orbit, then fill a planet
lander with crew and send them down.  You will usually want to scan
the planet first.  Mineral scans will indicate easily harvestable
mineral ores and other resources.  Energy scans will indicate unusual
installations, which will effectively always be worth investigating.
Biological scans will show where life forms are on the surface.

Minerals are necessary for building up and maintaining your flagship,
so harvest them wherever you can.  There are nine varieties, each
color coded:

COMMON ELEMENTS (carbon, nitrogen) are cyan. Worth 1 resource unit
(RU) per unit.

CORROSIVES (chlorine, iodine) are red.  2 RU per unit.

BASE METALS (iron, tin) are grey.  These are common, and usually worth
harvesting, but not terribly valuable.  3 RU per unit.

NOBLE GASSES (argon, xenon) are blue.  4 RU per unit.

RARE EARTHS (lanthanum, ytterbium) are green.  5 RU per unit.

PRECIOUS ELEMENTS (gold, silver) are yellow.  6 RU per unit.

RADIOACTIVES (uranium, astatine) are orange.  8 RU per unit.

EXOTICS (antimatter, magnetic monopoles) are purple, and a princely 25
RU per cargo unit.

Minerals may be unloaded at Earth Starbase by talking to Commander
Hayes, which will give you RU that you may spend to upgrade your
flagship.

However, there are many hazards on planetary surfaces.  Life forms are
often hostile, and need to be subdued with your stunner or evaded.
Earthquakes (expanding circles) can hurt your crew, lightning may
crisp them, or lava flows and hotspots can fry them.  Be careful,
especially on hotter or more seismically and atmospherically active
worlds.  If your crew level starts dropping dramatically, flee quickly
with the ESCAPE key!

Stunned life forms may be captured and analyzed by your planet
landers.  The information you gain from this may not be immediately
useful, but it will eventually come in handy.

Landing on a planet costs fuel, and the heavier the planet, the more
fuel it requires. Make sure you don't spend so much fuel exploring
planets that you can't get back to Sol!

			 INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL

When you leave a solar system, you will push up into HyperSpace.  In
HyperSpace you can travel great distances quickly, but you must
continuously thrust to move.  Otherwise, you will gradually slow to a
stop.

While you can fly about in HyperSpace just like you do in a star
system, the Galaxy is LARGE, and you will usually want to use the
Auto-Pilot.  To use the Auto-Pilot, select "Starmap" on the menu.
This will show you a map of the quadrant (the galactic Core is in the
upper right corner).  To fly to a location, move the cursor there and
press Enter.  Then press Space to engage the Auto-Pilot.

			      DIPLOMACY

When you encounter an alien starship, you will usually get a picture
of their task force and a chance to choose between conversation and
fighting.  If you choose to fight, you will transition immediately to
space combat (below).  Otherwise, you will talk first.  If talks go
poorly, space combat will likely ensue.

If the task force shows ships streaming off in all directions, you
have reached a fortified world, and there are an unlimited number of
starships facing you.  You cannot win such a fight - if combat ensues,
you will need to warp out.

			     SPACE COMBAT

When combat begins, you are prompted to select a ship from your task
force.  A one-on-one space combat then begins, and continues until
either the enemy fleet is destroyed (in which case you salvage the
wrecks and continue the game), your flagship is destroyed (ending the
game), or your flagship warps out of combat (consuming 5 fuel units
but ending the encounter).

Each ship has two major stats: Crew and Combat Battery.  Crew are
effectively hit points.  Getting hit by weapons kills crew, and if all
crew are eliminated, the craft is destroyed.  Firing weapons typically
requires energy from the combat batteries, which is replaced over
time.  The precise speed of energy regeneration and cost of weapons
fire varies by ship.

Space flight is *mostly* inertial (you'll drift if you stop
thrusting), but each ship has a maximum velocity that can only be
exceeding by "gravity whipping" around the planet.  Don't hit the
planet unless you want to take LOTS of damage.

Each ship has a primary and secondary weapon mode, unique to that
race's craft.  The descriptions of those follow.

			  SHIP DESCRIPTIONS

Secondary weapon: "Syreen Call" - psychic attack that induces enemy
crew to jump ship, where you (or your opponent) may capture them to
add to your complement

			   Thraddash Torch
Primary weapon:  Straightforward blaster cannon.

damage then the blaster, so use it as a weapon!

			     Umgah Drone
Primary weapon:  Anti-Matter cone.  Does not require combat batteries to use.
Secondary weapon:  Fly backwards suddenly and at high speed.
Note: The Drone only recharges batteries if you do not fire for a long
time, and then the energy all returns in one lump.

			 Ur-Quan Dreadnought
Primary weapon:  Fusion Blast.
Secondary weapon: Launches autonomous fighters to harrass the enemy.
When they run low on fuel, they will fly back to the Dreadnought.
Catch them before they expire.  Each fighter requires one crew to
pilot it, so take care not to weaken the core ship.

			     Utwig Jugger
Primary weapon: Six-shot cannon.  Requires no combat battery energy to fire.

down dramatically if they hit.

			   Yehat Terminator
Primary weapon: Twin autocannons.
Secondary weapon: Force shield.

			 Zoq-Fot-Pik Stinger

These controls are configurable by editing the key.cfg file which will
be automatically generated in your personal directory for uqm data the
first time you start the game.
The location of this directory varies per system.
On Microsoft Windows systems this is a folder named 'uqm' in the
application data folder for the current user.
This is usually in one of the following locations:
- "C:\Windows\Application Data\"
  (Windows 95, 98, SE without separate users)
- "C:\Windows\Profiles\YourName\Application Data\"
  (Windows 95/98/SE with separate users)
- "C:\Documents and Settings\YourName\Application Data\"
  (Windows NT/XP)
On Unix systems this personal uqm data is stored in "~/.uqm".

Later versions of The Ur-Quan Masters will include a key configuration
tool.  In the meantime, the "starcon.key" file in the root fo the
content directory has information about how to add support for
joysticks or remap keys.
