To build The Urquan Masters, you need at least the following software:

GCC - GNU C Compiler
	http://gcc.gnu.org/
	Debian package: gcc

GNU Make
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/
	Debian package: make

Additionally, The Urquan Masters requires the following libraries:

OpenGL v1.2
	http://www.xfree86.org/
	Debian package: xlibmesa-dev OR nvidia-glx OR <vendor specific>
	XFree86 4.x comes with Mesa, which is a clone.
	Note: Mesa is a software emulation. For enjoyable results 
	you will need hardware accelerated OpenGL (GLX).
	These usally conflict with mesa (can result in X server crash)

SDL v1.2
	The Simple Direct-Media Layer
	A fairly good multiplatform low level graphics library.
	Homepage: www.libsdl.org
	Debian package: libsdl1.2-dev (and various runtime debs)
