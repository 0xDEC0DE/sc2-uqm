To build The Ur-Quan Masters, you need at least the following software:

For Linux version:
GCC - GNU C Compiler
	http://gcc.gnu.org/
	Debian package: gcc

GNU Make
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/
	Debian package: make

For Windows version:
Microsoft Visual C++ 6 or 7

Additionally, The Ur-Quan Masters requires the following libraries:
Note that dependancies can differ between different OS's.

OpenGL v1.2 (if HAVE_OPENGL is defined, which is the default)
    Win32 users should have all by default, following is for Linux version:
	http://www.xfree86.org/
	Debian package: xlibmesa-dev OR nvidia-glx OR <vendor specific>
	XFree86 4.x comes with Mesa, which is a clone.
	Note: Mesa is a software emulation. For enjoyable results 
	you will need hardware accelerated OpenGL (GLX).
	These usually conflict with mesa (can result in X server crash).
