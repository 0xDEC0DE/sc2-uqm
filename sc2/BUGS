IMPORTANT!
Before sending new bug reports, read the TODO file, Changelog file,
and this file. Do not report a bug that has already been reported.
Time we spend on reading duplicate bug reports could have been spent
on fixing them. Also note that these files are changed when new bugs
are found, so if you haven't read them for a while, please do so before
reporting a bug.

Don't expect a reply on your bug reports. Though we do appreciate them, it
would take too much time to reply to them all. All bugs will be noted
and addressed in time.

The TODO file contains verified bugs.
The Changelog file contains issues fixed since the last release.
This file contains issues that need further inspection before deciding
it's a bug.


Some general comments:
- Keyboard problems are very likely caused by your keyboard. Not all
  keyboards accept all combinations. Results may be that the new key is
  ignored, or the old key is seen as released (or both).
  The original PC sc2 had a key jamming program so you could test which
  combinations had problems. We intend to bring back in some form
  a key configurationg program and some key jammer (possibly the same
  program).
  The only keyboard I know that can accept every key at the same time being
  pressed are is an old BTC type. For typing it wasn't really that good
  though IMHO. [Meep-Eep]


The bugs reported but not yet verified:
- "Whenever i'm in autopilot mode in hyperspace and i enter into combat with
  the slylandro, the combat moves at the fastest speed possible"

- melee: "some times the bottom ships portrait appears on opposite side of
  the screen"

- "After visiting all the rainbow worlds and getting the new melnorme
  technology (enhancing your planet lander) you aren't able to land on
  planets anymore.  As soon as your lander hits the surface, it takes off
  again, as if a key was stuck down (which I checked for, of course..).  I'm
  sure this is just a minor problem in the lander code, but it does need to
  be fixed for sure."

- "Have the speech voices turned down? I noticed that even you have the speech
  voices off, it playes them and it takes a while until it has, how would I
  say it, "spoken" the speeches. Pretty annoying especially when you don't
  have the speeches on to just wait for an eternity for the conversation to
  stop. You notice this also by pressing space immidiately whent the Ur-Quan
  Drone pops up to bother you."

- "another difference or bug vs. pc version, the sun
  in all the large stars e.g. alpha centauri is too small"

- "The fuel range calculator on the starmap does not work correctly.  If you
  set course for a system that apears in range, you will run out of fuel
  before you get there. "

- "i was at autopilot, and just saved the game.
  after quitting the game and reloading to save, it continues to fly to
  sol(the location I have set to auto pilot) only it flies like it flies
  right, instead of down. probably the flagship images prob"

- "For some odd reason, the new graphical menus are constantly freezing on
  me.  I've played 15 times so far.  10 times it froze while I was trying to
  use the menu (in regular, Bilateral, and Sai graphics modes), once while I
  was landing on a planet (Bilateral), once when talking to Fwiffo
  (Bilateral), once while leaving a planet (Bilateral), and twice as soon as
  I pressed the thrust key upon starting the game (only times I ever used
  SuperSai)." (slow computer)

- "The laser beam for the Arilou ship should be white (I think) but it is
  displayed as yellow in UQM."
