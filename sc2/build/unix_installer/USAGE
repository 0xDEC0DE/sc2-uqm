Making a release binary:

- Build the game in release mode.

- From the top of the cvs tree, run the following command, but
  change the actual arguments to suit your needs.
  The first one is the name of the final executable, the second a
  space-seperated list of possible content files the installer will look
  for.

  	build/unix_installer/buildinstaller.sh uqm-0.2-linux-dynamic.sh \
  			"content.tgz"
