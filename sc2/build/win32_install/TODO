Things stiill needing doing of rthe installer:
 - untgz.dll doesn't support error checking yet
 - check md5 sums on downloaded files
 - Read previous install directory from registry
 - Allow users to choose mirror, rather than randomly choosing one
 - Only read mirror file once, if only 1 is used.
 - use uqm icon for the installer
