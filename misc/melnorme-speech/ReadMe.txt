These are the work files for the Melnorme number speech. The 3DO original
speech only had numbers 1 through 16 to enumerate the modules Melnorme
would strip from the player's ship to give him fuel. The rest of the numbers
were generated by splicing the appropriate phonemes, e.g. "eigh" + "ty" = "eighty"
Note that Melnorme speech is still missing a "zero".
